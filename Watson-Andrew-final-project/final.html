				<p>Kayaking is the use of a Kayak for moving across water. Over the years, kayaking has 
				evolved into a popular water sport. It is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting 
				position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is defined by the 
				<abbr title="International Canoe Federation">ICF</abbr> (the world sanctioning body)
				 as a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. 
				 Most kayaks have closed decks, although "sit-on-top" and inflatable kayaks are growing 
				 in popularity as well.

				<p><strong>Eight Primary Classifications of Kayaking</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>Polo</li>
						<li>Slalom</li>
						<li>Whitewater</li>
						<li>Surf</li>
						<li>Touring/expedition</li>
						<li>Light touring/day tripping</li>
						<li>Sprint/racing</li>
						<li>General recreation</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div id="column3of6">
				<p>From these primary classifications stem many sub-classes. For example, 
				a fishing kayak is simply a general-recreation kayak outfitted with 
				accessories that make it easier from which to fish. A creek kayak is a 
				certain type of whitewater kayak, designed to handle narrow gully type 
				rivers and falls. Also within these classifications are 
				many levels of performance which further separate the individual models.<br/>
				Beginners will typically start out with a general recreation kayaks.

				<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
				<div id="column4of6">
				<p>Kayaks are also classified by their design and the materials from which
				 they are made. Each design has its specific advantage, including 
				 performance, manoeuvrability, stability, and paddling style. Kayaks can 
				 be made of metal, fibreglass, wood, plastic, fabrics, and inflatable 
				 fabrics such as PVC or rubber. Each material also has its specific 
				 advantage, including strength, durability, portability, flexibility, 
				 resistance to UV, and storage requirements. For example, Wooden kayaks 
				 can be created from kits or built by hand, but they are heavy to transport.
				  Inflatable kayaks, made from lightweight fabric, can be dried, deflated, 
				  and stored.<br/>
				  When kayaks are built by hand, it is common to use software systems to 
				  aid the craftsman to ensure proper buoyancy and displacement.</p>
				  </div>
				  
				<h2 id="configurations">Configurations</h2>
				<div id="column5of6">
				<p>There are several major configurations of kayaks. "Sit on tops", as the
				 name suggests, involve sitting on top of the kayak in an open area. 
				 "Cockpit style" involves sitting with the legs and hips inside the kayak 
				 hull with a spray deck or "spray skirt" that creates a water resistant 
				 seal around the waist. "Inflatables" are a hybrid of the two previous 
				 configurations, these boats have an open deck, but the paddler sits below
				 the level of the deck. "Tandems" are configured for multiple paddlers, 
				 in contrast to the single person designs featured by most kayaks. Tandems
				 can be used by two or even three paddlers. How a kayak is configured has
				 nothing to do with its classification. All configurations are 
				 represented in each of the five primary classifications.

				<h3 id="activities">Activities involving kayaks</h3>
				<div id="column6of6">
				<p>Because of their range and adaptability, kayaks can be useful for other
				 outdoor activities such as diving, fishing, wilderness exploration and 
				 search and rescue during floods.
